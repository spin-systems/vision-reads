Readings in computer vision

### _ever and anon from life science angles,_ 

maintaining domain focus in computer vision while giving license for side excursions to indulge biological models and/or functional analogies: neural networks have clearly made the crossover, while computer scientists are less open to parse neurodegeneration, sensorimotor disorder etc. from such (important, moreover fruitful) outlooks

> ### _ears of rice, the river mouth, brightness, bloom, and bulbs_

by more fruitful I mean to say that these processes of the industrial world evoke a fuller sensorium when giving nature its due diligence.

Studying memory and our models of how the brain processes suggests to me that this broad-minded approach gives thought - in the immediate moment - constructive feedback. It's also encouragingly found in the range of subject matter in early ‘_cybernetics_’; control theorists, engineers & co., from Weiner to Conway

I'd propose biology merits a continued grounding in this field, not least to benefit the eyes and minds of future scientists.
