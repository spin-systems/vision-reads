Readings in computer vision

### _ever and anon from life science angles,_ 

maintaining domain focus in computer vision while giving license for side excursions to indulge biological models and/or functional analogies: neural networks have clearly made the crossover, while computer scientists are less open to parse neurodegeneration, sensorimotor disorder etc. from such important (moreover, fruitful) outlooks

by more fruitful I mean to say that these processes of the industrial world evoke a fuller sensorium when giving nature its due.

- As a systems biology student, I find myself compelled to expose these isomorphisms, from electrical engineering to bioenergetic signalling and so on. Hopefully my writing is clear enough for readers to follow these routes too :grinning:

Studying memory and our models of how the brain processes suggests to me that this broad-minded approach gives thought - in the immediate moment - constructive feedback. It's also encouragingly found in the range of subject matter in early ‘_cybernetics_’; control theorists, engineers & co., from Weiner to Conway

I'd propose biology merits a continued grounding in this field, not least to benefit the eyes and minds of future scientists.
